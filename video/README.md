Problems:
 
not knowing what to study

the requirements are not inclusive to every student

when students apply to work for free they are exploitered

no one keeps companies accountable when exploiting students

companies do not approach students which would solve the access problem and not having the flexibility to explore positions in an org so students can bounce around to know what position works for them.

entry levels can easily navigate the selection process
